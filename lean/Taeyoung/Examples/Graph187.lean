# Atlas 187: verified clique--odd-cycle join example

graph6: `Ehfw`.  The edge-list definition below is the Lean graph;
the graph6 string is stable external metadata until a verified decoder exists.

The base bound is the `C5` case of the odd-cycle Goodman bound
(`Methods/OddCycleC5`), which assumes nothing about the edge density.
Its target factors as `z(2z-1)(z^2 + (1-z)^2)`, so it vanishes at
`1/2` and is nonnegative above it, and the quartic remainder of its
tangent at `c` factors as `(w-c)^2` times a polynomial with
nonnegative coefficients in `w - 1/2` and `c - 1/2`.  The cone has
no simplicial vertex, so its chromatic polynomial comes from the
general cone identity `chi_{K1 v F}(x) = x*chi_F(x-1)` rather than
from an attachment tower.
It is transported to this graph along the explicit relabelling `relabel`, whose
adjacency correspondence `iso_adj` is checked by kernel computation.
