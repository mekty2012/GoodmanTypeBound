# Atlas 38: verified odd-cycle example

graph6: `Dhc`.  The edge-list definition below is the Lean graph;
the graph6 string is stable external metadata until a verified decoder exists.

The bound is the `C₅` case of the odd-cycle Goodman bound of the
`OddCycleBound` dependency, carried to the shared density layer by
`cycleDensity_bridge` and `edgeDensity_bridge` in `Methods/OddCycleC5`,
and combined with the five-cycle chromatic polynomial `(X-1)^5 - (X-1)`
proved in `Chromatic.lean`.
It is transported to this graph along the explicit relabelling `relabel`, whose
adjacency correspondence `iso_adj` is checked by kernel computation.
