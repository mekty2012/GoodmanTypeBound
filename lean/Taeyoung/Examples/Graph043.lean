# Atlas 43: verified exact rooted-SOS certificate

graph6: `Dlc`.  The edge-list definition below is the Lean graph;
the graph6 string is stable external metadata until a verified decoder exists.

The proof runs through `Taeyoung.Methods.RootedSOS.Atlas43`, a chain of
1,097 modules of `decide +kernel` cells.  Verified sequentially on
2026-09-22: every module compiles, the final theorem uses only the three
standard axioms, about six hours in total, peak 15.4 GiB on one module.  Build
it one module at a time (`lean/tools/verify_catalogue.py`), never with a
parallel `lake build`.
