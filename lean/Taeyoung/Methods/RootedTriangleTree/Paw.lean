# The paw: the first row from the link layer

The paw is `L₁` of the rooted triangle–tree family
(`notes/rooted_triangle_tree_extensions.pdf`): a triangle with one leaf at
a distinguished root.  Conditioning on the root gives

```
t(L₁, W) = ∫ d(x) · τ(x) dμ(x)
```

and the weighted rooted-triangle inequality plus Jensen turn that into the
target `p²(2p-1)`.

This file supplies the analytic half; the chromatic half is
`Methods/Chromatic/PawExample.lean`.

/-! ### The family bound, once and for all

`L_r` is a triangle with `r` leaves at a distinguished root.  Everything about
the family except the rooted factorization is uniform in `r`, so it is proved
here once; an Atlas module then supplies only

* the chromatic polynomial `x(x-1)^{r+1}(x-2)`,
* the chromatic number `3`, and
* the factorization `t(H,W) = ∫ dʳ·τ`.
