# Atlas 126: the tangency corners

Two of the note's carve-outs are neighbourhoods of an exact contact, where no
subdivision can converge because the residual genuinely vanishes.  Both are
handled by factoring the contact out and certifying the leftover quadratic form.

On the face `a = (t+p)/2` the residual vanishes to second order at the
multipartite point `(d,t) = (p, p(2p-1))`, so in the shifted coordinates
`δ = d - p`, `τ = t - p(2p-1)` it is exactly

```
Φ = A·δ² + B·δτ + C·τ²
```

with `A`, `B`, `C` polynomial.  `quadratic_nonneg` then reduces nonnegativity to
three scalar facts — `A ≥ 0`, `C ≥ 0`, `4AC ≥ B²` — which hold with comfortable
margins on a tube around the contact (`0.59`, `0.10`, `0.23` for a tube of
radius `1/10` at `p ≤ 9/10`).  Outside the tube the residual is bounded away
from zero and ordinary box certificates apply.

The two coefficient relations that make the region-H plane tangent rather than
merely touching are recorded here as `ring` identities; they are the region-H
analogue of `β = 2γρ` in `Slab.lean`.

/-- **A positive semidefinite binary quadratic form is nonnegative.**  The proof
is the completed square `4A(Aδ² + Bδτ + Cτ²) = (2Aδ + Bτ)² + (4AC - B²)τ²`,
with the degenerate case `A = 0` handled separately. -/

/-! ### The region-H coefficients

`γ_H = 2p(9p² - 10p + 3)` and `β_H = p(30p³ - 29p² + 6p + 1)` are not chosen,
they are forced: `β_H` is exactly what makes the plane tangent to the face
`a = (t+p)/2` at the multipartite point. -/

/-- `9p² - 10p + 3 > 0`: the discriminant is `-8`, so completing the square
gives `9(p - 5/9)² + 2/9`. -/

/-! ### The ternary criterion

The `x = 0` contact of region L is an interior critical point of the residual in
all three of `d`, `a`, `t`, with Hessian

```
[ 3/16   1/8  -1/4 ]
[ 1/8    1/2    0  ]
[ -1/4    0     1  ]
```

whose leading minors are `3/16`, `5/64`, `3/64` -- positive definite, so that
contact is nondegenerate too.  Certifying it needs the ternary analogue of
`quadratic_nonneg`, obtained by completing one square and appealing to the
binary case on what is left:

```
a·q = (a·x + u·y + v·z)^2 + (ab - u^2)y^2 + 2(aw - uv)yz + (ac - v^2)z^2.
```
