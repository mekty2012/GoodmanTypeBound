# `K₄` with a two-edge tail: the link reduction

`notes/k4_two_edge_tail.pdf` §3.  Conditioning the three non-tail clique
vertices through the link measure at `x` turns the rooted `K₄` density into
`d(x)³·t(K₃, W_x)`, and Goodman inside the link bounds that below.  Combined
with the pointwise `τ ≥ 2A - p` and monotonicity of `z ↦ z(2z-1)_+`, this gives
the completely elementary pointwise statement

```
d(x)·κ₄(x) ≥ u·(2u - d(x)²)_+,      u = (2A(x) - p)_+,
```

which is exactly the left-hand side of `K4Tail.plane_le_trunc`.  Everything the
note calls `F_p(d,a)` is carried in this truncated form, so no division by `d`
is ever performed and the zero-degree set needs no separate convention.

Goodman itself is the pure-chordal clique bound at `r = 3` — `cliquePoly 3 z =
z(2z-1)` — extended below the threshold by nonnegativity.
