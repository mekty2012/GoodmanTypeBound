# Atlas 178: the two half-degree supporting planes

`notes/atlas178_half_degree_weighted_k4.pdf` Lemma 3.1, in the square-root
coordinates `D = √d`, `r = √p`, so that both planes are polynomial.  Writing
`c₃ = 2p-1` and `c₄ = 3p-2`, the note's two claims are

```
(2D - r)·t ≥ p r c₃ + (3/2) r (4p-1)(d-p) + (3/2) r (a - d²),
(t/D)(2t - d² - c₄ d) ≥ 3 p r c₃ (d-p) + 2 r c₃ (a - d²),
```

the second multiplied through by `D` so that no quotient appears.

**Neither plane needs a Bernstein certificate.**  The note proves them by
conditional subdivision trees of 500 and 406 boxes.  Both are in fact explicit
nonnegative combinations of the feasibility slacks, obtained from the exact
linear (respectively quadratic) programming dual.  With

```
g₅ = t - 2a + p,   g₆ = t - a + d - d²,   g₈ = d² - t,
```

the three identities below are `ring` facts:

```
res₁ = (3/2)r·g₅ + (7r/2 - 4D)·g₈ + Φ_U                   on  8D ≤ 7r
res₁ = (5r - 4D)·g₅ + (8D - 7r)·g₆ + 2(D - r)²·L          on  8D ≥ 7r
res₂ = 2Drc₃·g₆ + 2(t - θ)² + (D/8)(D - r)²·M,  θ = D(D+r)(D²-Dr+4r²-2)/4
```

Plane 1 is affine in `(a,t)`, so its minimum is attained at a vertex of the
feasible polygon; the two duals above already cover the whole band, one on each
side of the line `8D = 7r`.  Plane 2 is convex in `t`, and completing the square
after removing `2Drc₃·g₆` leaves a remainder nonnegative on the whole box, so it
needs no case split at all.  In both planes the tangency at the balanced
tripartite graphon appears as an explicit `(D-r)²`, exactly as in
`Methods/K4Tail/Scalar.lean` and `Methods/Atlas160/Scalar.lean`.

The two leftover scalar factors are settled here without any box subdivision:
`L` by one `nlinarith`, and `Φ_U` by the two exact identities

```
256·H = 2078r⁵ + 2471(7r-8D)r⁴ + (7r-8D)²(289r³ + 1064r²D + 832rD² + 512D³),
32·Φ_U = H + r(25r² - 16)(5r² - 6D²),  H = 128D⁵ - 16D⁴r - 234D²r³ + 131r⁵,
```

in which every summand is visibly nonnegative on `0 ≤ 8D ≤ 7r`, `r² ≥ 16/25`.

the homogeneous quintic `H`, and `H` has all-positive coefficients once written
