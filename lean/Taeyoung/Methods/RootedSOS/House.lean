# Atlas 43 (the house graph): finite and chromatic reduction

This is the graph-specific shell around the exact rooted-SOS certificate from
`notes/atlas43_exact_rooted_sos.pdf`.  The certificate (the `Atlas43*` modules)
proves the analytic inequality, which the theorem below takes as the hypothesis
`house_bound`; this file does the finite graph and chromatic work and turns that
inequality into the catalogue proposition.

The graph is a four-cycle `0-1-2-3-0` with a roof vertex `4` on the edge
`0-3`.  Its chromatic polynomial is

```
r (r - 1) (r - 2) (r^2 - 3r + 3),
```

so the catalogue target is

```
p (2p - 1) (3p^2 - 3p + 1).
```

/-- **A graphon proof of the exact house inequality implies the Atlas 43
catalogue proposition.**

This is the interface consumed by the rooted-SOS certificate: its analytic
side only has to establish `houseTarget p ≤ t(houseGraph,W)` on `p ≥ 1/2`.
The chromatic polynomial, chromatic number, admissibility conversion, and the
endpoint `p = 1` are all handled here. -/
