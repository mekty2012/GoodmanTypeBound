# Atlas 148: the chromatic data, and the catalogue proposition

## The Atlas 148 development

`notes/atlas148_paw_bias_hilbert_projection.pdf` splits at `p = 3/5`.

The **high interval** `[3/5, 1]` needs no triangle-density input.
`Scalar.lean` proves the pointwise supporting line, `GeoMean.lean` the three
facts about `Z = √(d(x)d(y))`, `Linear.lean` the estimate `p²G - qΔ ≥ pcf`,
`Projection.lean` the linearized two-term Bessel bound, and `High.lean`
assembles them; `Density.lean` supplies the peeling identity, so
`homDensity_graph148_high` bounds the homomorphism density itself.

The **low interval** `[1/2, 3/5]` needs the sharp triangle profile, which is
where Fisher's theorem enters through `Methods/TriangleDensity/Fisher.lean`.
`LowScalar.lean` holds everything scalar in that branch: the two coordinates,
the comparison `c²f ≤ p·g(p)²`, the normalized monotonicity, and the two
lemmas that feed a tilted triangle bound through to `p·g(p) ≤ z·T` — one for
each side of the `s = 2/3` split, where Fisher hands over to Goodman.

`LowEdge.lean` supplies the analytic inputs `M³ ≤ p` and `N³ ≥ p⁵` that those
lemmas consume, by one two-factor Cauchy--Schwarz where the note uses a
three-factor Hölder.  `LowSymm.lean` proves the leaf symmetrization, and
`Low.lean` builds the tilt `ν = d^{1/3}μ/M`, applies Fisher below `s = 2/3`
and Goodman above it, and assembles the interval.  `homDensity_graph148_bound`
is the note's analytic theorem in full, on `[1/2, 1]`.

## The chromatic data

The chromatic polynomial is

```
χ_{F₁₄₈}(r) = r(r-1)(r-2)²(r²-3r+3),
```

whose last factor is irreducible over the rationals.  The catalogue's usual
route for a positive row — an attachment tower over a clique, read off by
`affineProd` — therefore does not apply: those towers only ever produce
products of affine factors.  What does apply is the surjective-count route the
negative rows use, `isChromaticPolynomial_of_surjCount`, with the six counts
checked by `decide +kernel`.  The five-colour count is the expensive one; the
top count is supplied by `surjCount_card` instead of being enumerated.

The target is then obtained the way `Methods/OddCycleC5/Chromatic.lean` does
it, by `chromaticTarget_of_ne_one` and one `field_simp; ring`, rather than by
`chromaticTarget_affineProd`:

```
Φ_{F₁₄₈}(p) = (1-p)⁶·χ(1/(1-p)) = p(2p-1)²(3p²-3p+1).
```
